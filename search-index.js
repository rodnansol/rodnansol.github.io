Table of Contents Available tasks Setup Single module / Single project Multi-module / Multiple sub projects Available tasks and configurations Configuration GeneratePropertyDocumentTask GenerateAndAggregateDocumentsTask The plugin is built with Java 11 and Gradle 6.1.1 API, make sure requirements are met. The plugin is built like the Maven plugin, it has the same functionalities, but in the Gradle world. In this documentation the usage is being show, and the samples can be checked in the samples/gradle folder from the root.

Code formatter Commit messages Contributors The Spring Framework is a really powerful tool that lets you build simple and complex application with Java. Developers have been using it as their main framework to build applications, and during any software development developers tend to make their solutions future-proof and highly customizable. To make sure these goals could be achieved proper requirements and documents are required for the team and the software. As the software is being built and new features are being implemented and as the codebase is growing, developers tend to make shortcuts, and they stop writing documentations, the requirements are getting weaker and the quality of the software is getting worse. Developers like to automatize most of their \"boring\" tasks and creating documentation is a good candidate for this one, if the code itself contains enough information to make it as the \"official\" documentation, then why shouldn’t we utilize tools that achieve these goals? The Spring Framework ships an annotation processing library that creates metadata from the classes thar are annotation with the @ConfigurationProperties annotation. This library is called spring-boot-configuration-processor and you can read more about it here: Configuration Metadata. After your application has this dependency during build time the annotation processor will kick in and a so called spring-configuration-metadata.json file will be created, that will represent your @ConfigurationProperties annotated classes in a JSON file format, these are metadata about your classes. An example class and its metadata An example configuration property class @Component @ConfigurationProperties(prefix = \"this.is.my\") class MyProperties { /** * This is my variable. */ private String variable; @Deprecated(since = \"Since you are a pilot\") private String anotherVariable = \"with default value\"; /** * A duration. */ private Duration duration = Duration.ofDays(2); private Instant instant = Instant.ofEpochSecond(123); private LocalDate date = LocalDate.of(1995, 10, 20); private LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.of(1995, 10, 20, 0, 1, 2, 3); // Getters & Setters @DeprecatedConfigurationProperty(reason = \"Because it is deprecated\", replacement = \"instant\") public Duration getDuration() { return duration; } } Generated spring-configuration-metadata.json file { \"groups\": [ { \"name\": \"this.is.my\", \"type\": \"org.rodnansol.MyProperties\", \"sourceType\": \"org.rodnansol.MyProperties\" } ], \"properties\": [ { \"name\": \"this.is.my.date\", \"type\": \"java.time.LocalDate\", \"sourceType\": \"org.rodnansol.MyProperties\" }, { \"name\": \"this.is.my.date-time\", \"type\": \"java.time.LocalDateTime\", \"sourceType\": \"org.rodnansol.MyProperties\" }, { \"name\": \"this.is.my.instant\", \"type\": \"java.time.Instant\", \"sourceType\": \"org.rodnansol.MyProperties\" }, { \"name\": \"this.is.my.variable\", \"type\": \"java.lang.String\", \"description\": \"This is my variable.\", \"sourceType\": \"org.rodnansol.MyProperties\" }, { \"name\": \"this.is.my.another-variable\", \"type\": \"java.lang.String\", \"sourceType\": \"org.rodnansol.MyProperties\", \"deprecated\": true, \"deprecation\": {} }, { \"name\": \"this.is.my.duration\", \"type\": \"java.time.Duration\", \"description\": \"A duration.\", \"sourceType\": \"org.rodnansol.MyProperties\", \"deprecated\": true, \"deprecation\": { \"reason\": \"Because it is deprecated\", \"replacement\": \"instant\" } } ], \"hints\": [] } This tool is going to read and process this metadata file, and it is able to generate shiny \"documentations\" in different formats. This tool will let you create: Markdown AsciiDoc HTML XML More to come…​ styled documents about your configuration properties. The tool is using Handlebars as the templating engine, if you would like to create custom templates check the Template customization section. You can use our Maven plugin or our Gradle plugin to utilize the document generation tool. Check out the samples folder for the different samples. If you are using Spring with Quarkus, you can use this tool as well, please check out the Quarkus example in the samples folder. AsciiDoc Markdown HTML XML mvn clean package \\ org.rodnansol:spring-configuration-property-documenter-maven-plugin:0.6.1:generate-property-document \\ -Dtype=ADOC An Asciidoc based property documentation should be available in your target/property-docs folder. pom.xml org.rodnansol spring-configuration-property-documenter-maven-plugin 0.6.1 generate-adoc-without-deprecation-and-type process-classes generate-property-document ADOC Don’t worry, we have a Gradle plugin as well, check it out here. The tool has been built with Java and there are different entry points to it, but to be able to use it there are a few requirements: Java 11 In case of a Maven project you need Maven 3 at least. The project is currently having the following modules: spring-configuration-property-documenter-core spring-configuration-property-documenter-maven-plugin jbang (Not Maven Module) spring-configuration-property-documenter-gradle-plugin This Maven module contains the \"core\" codebase for the whole project, other modules are just entry points to this core module. This Maven module is a Maven plugin implementation, please check the Maven plugin part for the available goals and configuration. If you are not willing to use the Maven/Gradle plugin (that is coming soon), and you are familiar with JBang you can use this module where a PropertyDocumenter script is resides, to have a new entry point to the tool. Please read the JBang for more information. This Maven module is a Gradle plugin implementation, please check the Gradle part for the available goals and configuration. As said before the tool can be executed by multiple tools, by far probably the most convenient is going to be the Maven and Gradle plugin, but we offer another approach with JBang. Maven plugin Gradle plugin JBang Template customization Please fork the project if you would like to contribute. The project requires at least Java 11, if sdkman is installed on your machine sdk e command could be used in the terminal to set up the required Java version. To build the project just run: mvn verify -Pbuild - The build profile is required to access the Gradle dependencies If you want to build the samples run: mvn install and then mvn package -f samples/pom.xml The project contains a .editorconfig file, and it should be utilized as well. During build time Checkstyle checks the conventions. The commit messages are based on the conventional-commits, please apply those rules. Learn more here.

The plugin is built with Java 11 and Maven 3.8.1 API, make sure requirements are met. The multi-module setup will need a \"small\" trick/hack to achieve the things we want. Table of Contents Setup Single module Multi-module Available goals and configuration Configuration generate-property-document generate-and-aggregate-documents aggregate-documents In this case the story is relatively simple, you have to only insert the following code snippet to your pom.xml and after that you can use it immediately. The plugin is having multiple goals at this moment, please check out the documentation and customization for those. Spring’s annotation processor will kick in the compile phase, and because of that the plugin must be linked after that lifecycle, for example the process-classes. pom.xml ... org.rodnansol spring-configuration-property-documenter-maven-plugin latest-version generate-adoc process-classes generate-property-document ADOC generate-markdown process-classes generate-property-document MARKDOWN generate-html process-classes generate-property-document HTML ... In this example 3 files are going to be created with different extensions (Markdown, AsciiDoc, HTML). Bigger projects are going to be containing multiple Maven modules and the plugin is also prepared for those cases as well, we can generate the document for each module, and we are going to be able to aggregate them. There are two supported options right now. For these cases we have to introduce a new module that will contain all the other modules as its dependencies, with this \"trick\" we can ensure that the plugin will be invoked at the end of the Maven build and all the required resources (the spring-configuration-metadata.json files) will be already generated (without those it will be really hard to generate the final docucment). Check the diagram below: In the multi-module-docs module we have to configure the plugin: pom.xml org.rodnansol spring-configuration-property-documenter-maven-plugin latest-version aggregate-docs-markdown generate-and-aggregate-documents package MARKDOWN Multi Module A Multi Module A properties with a folder input ../multi-module-a Multi Module B Multi Module B properties with a jar file input ../multi-module-b/target/multi-module-b-999-SNAPSHOT.jar Multi Module C Multi Module C properties with a specific file input ../multi-module-c/target/classes/META-INF/spring-configuration-metadata.json target/aggregated-md.md aggregate-docs-markdown-adoc generate-and-aggregate-documents package ADOC Multi Module A Multi Module A properties with a folder input ../multi-module-a Multi Module B Multi Module B properties with a jar file input ../multi-module-b/target/multi-module-b-999-SNAPSHOT.jar Multi Module C Multi Module C properties with a specific file input ../multi-module-c/target/classes/META-INF/spring-configuration-metadata.json target/aggregated-adoc.adoc aggregate-docs-markdown-html generate-and-aggregate-documents package HTML Multi Module A Multi Module A properties with a folder input ../multi-module-a Multi Module B Multi Module B properties with a jar file input ../multi-module-b/target/multi-module-b-999-SNAPSHOT.jar Multi Module C Multi Module C properties with a specific file input ../multi-module-c/target/classes/META-INF/spring-configuration-metadata.json target/aggregated-html.html The generate-and-aggregate-documents goal is not linked to any lifecycle, but it must be run after all the other modules have been built. We use the package lifecycle here, but other can be used as well, the dependency association will make sure that this module can not be built until the other dependencies are not available/built. As we can see in the input tags we can define an input field that can be: a specific spring-configuration-metadata.json file a directory (that must contain the spring-configuration-metadata.json in the children directories) a jar file (that must contain the spring-configuration-metadata.json in the META-INF directory) Goal Description generate-property-document This goal reads the spring-configuration-metadata.json file from any given source (input file, directory or JAR file) and generates a single document for the given module. It is good to document a single application or a single module. generate-and-aggregate-documents This goal reads all the given spring-configuration-metadata.json files from the given/specified sources and it will be generating one single document that will contain all documentation created by the given sources. This goal is good for a multi module setup, it is able to read multiple files and aggregate them. aggregate-documents This goal reads all the given files and it will aggregates them into one big file. It is good if you have multiple different template based documentation and you would like to aggregate them into one. This is not going to generate documents only aggregate the given ones, this has a different purpose than the generate-and-aggregate-documents.

With that we are able to create smaller files, and we can render them together. If you would like to use your own templates as inputs you should first read through the following section to know which parameters you can use in your template. Table of Contents Handlebars template compiler Default templates Template modes Examples Standard Compact AsciiDoc customizations Tag filtering ifdef and ifndef Directives Custom templates Custom template compiler Register custom template compiler Template variables TemplateCustomization subclasses i18n resources By default, the tool depends on the Handlebars 3rd party library to put life into the templates. With that said, Handlerbars supports custom helpers, and there are a few helpers, those can be used in any custom template. Helpers: as_env - (org.rodnansol.core.generator.template.handlebars.EnvironmentVariableHelper) - Renders the parameter property to its environment variable form. is_included - (org.rodnansol.core.generator.template.handlebars.IsIncludedHelper) - Checks if a given property can be rendred into the document or not. is_compact_mode - (org.rodnansol.core.generator.template.handlebars.IsCompactModeHelper) - Shows if the template mode is set to COMPACT or not. These can be configured with this object - Keys it can handle: class key type description defaultValue deprecation envFormat The provided/packaged templates can be found here: spring-configuration-property-documenter-core/src/main/resources/templates/single Contains the basic templates for a single module spring-configuration-property-documenter-core/src/main/resources/templates/aggregated Contains templates that could be used for multiple document aggregation spring-configuration-property-documenter-core/src/main/resources/templates/partials Contains the templates for the content, and for the HTML a few helper templates With the release of the 0.6.0 version the tool now supports different templates modes, the default and fallback option is called STANDARD With the template mode setting you can set how your template should look like, right now this customization option just selects different template for the different sections. Available modes: Standard - Default mode where the property group based properties are separated by the groups, and they are listed in different tables. Compact - All the properties from the available property groups are shown in one just one table, no grouping by property groups. In this case the keys will be shown with their fully qualified name. Check the template customizations for the setting.

ABC Markdown The final AsciiDoc files when they are being included, the rendered files are utilizing the following AsciiDoc related features: Tag filtering ifdef and ifndef Directives Every configuration property key is wrapped in a tag, and on include any tag can be ignored, or a specific list of configuration property keys can be set to include in the main documentation Example // tag::this.is.module.a[] === this.is.module.a *Class:* `com.example.multimodulea.ModuleAProperty` [cols=\"2,1,3,1,1\"] |=== |Key |Type |Description |Default value |Deprecation |variable-a |java.lang.String |This is my variable from module A. |Default value for module A | |=== // end::this.is.module.a[] Example include include::file.adoc[tags=my.property.key.a;my.property.key.b] include::file.adoc[tags=!my.property.key.a;my.property.key.b] With the ifdef and ifndef directives the content of the document can be manipulated and the tool gives you the following directives to play with: property-group-simple-title - Define this attribute to have the included document’s header style just a simple text and not a header It can be good if the configuration documentation is being included in a collapsible section property-group-discrete-heading - Define this attribute if the included document’s headers should be rendered as discrete headings It can be good if the configuration documentation is being included in a collapsible section If none of the attributes are configured, the typical (= based) headings will be used. Example file === this.is.module.a + *Class:* `com.example.multimodulea.ModuleAProperty` [cols=\"2,1,3,1,1\"] |=== |Key |Type |Description |Default value |Deprecation |variable-a |java.lang.String |This is my variable from module A. |Default value for module A | |=== Example include :property-group-simple-title: (1) include::file.adoc[] :property-group-simple-title!: (2) :property-group-discrete-heading: (3) include::file.adoc[] :property-group-discrete-heading!:(4) 1 Enable the simple titles 2 Disabled the simple titles to make sure another included files are not inheriting the attributes 3 Enable the discrete headings 4 Disabled the discrete headings to make sure another included files are not inheriting the attributes You are not forced to use our templates, we can understand it is not your taste and maybe the customization options for the provided ones are not that flexible for your (for example the HTML format). By default, as written above Handlebars is being used as the primary templating engine, and we are using the default settings, so if you create a template for yourself make sure you know the basic syntax and for all the templates the .hbs extension should be used, please check the provided templates for more information. For a single document only one template is being used, but for the aggregated documents the tool is using multiple templates to render the final template, it is because we are compiling the header, footer and the content section after each other, and we are merging them in the end. The custom templates can be provided with the Maven and Gradle plugins as well or with JBang if this is your preference. Make sure you use your custom template file names with the .hbs extension, because Handlebars will put it to the end of the file. By default, as written above Handlebars is being used as the primary templating engine, but it is fully understood if this tool does not suit your requirements, there are a lot of out there, and you might want to use that as the templating engine. It is doable! The tool is coming with an SPI (Service Provider Interface) extension where you can use your own org.rodnansol.core.generator.template.TemplateCompiler implementation and from the Maven or Gradle plugin you can set the compiler’s name. It has been available since the 0.2.0 version. You only have to implement one method for now: package org.rodnansol.core.generator.template; import edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.NonNull; import org.rodnansol.core.generator.DocumentGenerationException; /** * Class that handles the template compiling. * * @author nandorholozsnyak * @since 0.2.0 */ public interface TemplateCompiler { /** * Compiles the template with the given template data. * * If the template is not found an exception must be raised. * * @param templatePath path to the template that the compiler can understand and work with. * @param templateData template data. * @return templated populated and compiled with the given template data. * @throws DocumentGenerationException when the template compiler occurs an error. */ String compileTemplate(String templatePath, TemplateData templateData) throws DocumentGenerationException; /** * Returns the associated memory store. * * @since 0.6.0 */ @NonNull default TemplateCompilerMemoryStore getMemoryStore() { return ThreadLocalTemplateCompilerStore.INSTANCE; } } templatePath variable is that what you can set for yourself from the Maven and Gradle plugin which should be the path to the template that must be compiled. templateData variable is an object that is holding the converted data from the spring-configuration-metadata.json file. Check below for the available fields To register your service create a file named org.rodnansol.core.generator.template.TemplateCompiler under the META-INF/services directory and put your class’s fully qualified name into the file. To make sure you have the necessary classes, at least for now, you have to add the following dependency to your project: pom.xml org.rodnansol spring-configuration-property-documenter-core ${project.version} If this feature is going to get more visibility we will create an API module that would contain only the necessary classes to make sure your project is not polluted with a plugin dependency. The template variables are going to be the same, but if there is any compatibility issue with your compiling engine please let us know about the problem and open an issue to make sure we can handle these problems as well. Registration example pom.xml org.rodnansol spring-configuration-property-documenter-maven-plugin 999-SNAPSHOT org.rodnansol.example custom-template-compiler ${project.version} generate-markdown-custom-template-compiler process-classes generate-property-document MARKDOWN com.example.custom.CustomTemplateCompiler target/custom-compiler-document.md Make sure you add the Maven module that contains the service registration (with the META-INF/services folder) to the plugin’s dependency list, unless it will not recognize it. For a working example please check the samples/multi-module directory’s multi-module-c and custom-template-compiler module.

Hello World With the help of JBang, developers are able to create and share their scripts for the public! It can be done with a so called catalog. Catalogs (simple JSON files) can be put into a Git repository and other developers are able to fetch, build and run the scripts listed in them. An example jbang-catalog.json { \"catalogs\": { \"jooq\": { \"catalog-ref\": \"https://github.com/jooq/jbang-catalog/blob/HEAD/jbang-catalog.json\" }, \"rodnansol\": { \"catalog-ref\": \"https://github.com/rodnansol/jbang-catalog/blob/HEAD/jbang-catalog.json\", \"description\": \"Rodnan Sol JBang Catalog\" } }, \"aliases\": { \"hello\": { \"script-ref\": \"hello.java\", \"description\": \"Script that says hello back for each argument\" } }, \"templates\": { \"q-aws-lambda-tf\": { \"file-refs\": { \"{filename}\": \"aws/aws-lambda.java.qute\", \"build-application\": \"aws/build-application\", \"application.properties\": \"aws/application.properties\", \"lambda-{basename}.tf\": \"aws/lambda.tf.qute\" }, \"description\": \"Quarkus AWS Lambda template with Terraform template.

Let us introduce the JBang Catalog Document Generator that takes your jbang-catalog.json file and it converts to a: AsciiDoc Markdown document that can be put into your repository and others can easily browse your available scripts. name: update-catalog on: push: branches: - main workflow_dispatch: jobs: update-catalog-documentation: runs-on: ubuntu-latest name: Update catalog documentation if: startsWith(github.event.head_commit.message, 'Updating jbang-catalog documentation') != true steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - uses: rodnansol/jbang-catalog-document-generator-action@v0.1.0 (1) name: Generate catalog document with: version: early-access (2) arguments: generate jbang-catalog.json -o README.adoc --custom-header=header.adoc --include-generation-date=true (3) - name: Commit document changes shell: bash run: | git add README.adoc (4) git config --global user.email \"${{ secrets.COMMITTER_EMAIL }}\" git config --global user.name \"${{ secrets.COMMITTER_NAME }}\" git commit -m \"Updating jbang-catalog documentation\" (5) git push origin main 1 Add the rodnansol/jbang-catalog-document-generator-action to your action. Check the latest version before doing so. 2 Specify the version of the CLI tool you want to use. 3 By default, the generate jbang-catalog.json command will be executed with, if more customization is needed specify it here 4 Do not forget to add it to the staging area 5 Commit and then push the files More information about the action can be found here. Download the uber-jar/fatjar and run it with Java 17(!). java -jar jbang-catalog-document-generator-cli/target/jbang-catalog-document-generator-cli-999-SNAPSHOT.jar generate Usage: generate [-g] [-cc] [-cus] [-hfdr] [-toc] [-cf=] [-ch=] [-o=] [-pcn=] [-t=] [-toc-l=] [-toc-p=] [-toc-t=] [-tt=] Generates a documentation for a given jbang-catalog.json file The input JSON file to convert. -cc, --check-checksum Defines if the checksum check should be running or not.

A tool for JBang will not be truly JBang related if it would not be having a JBang script. Check the jbang folder for the script or check the releases the use the newly released stable one. Coming soon. The tool is available within a Docker image, check the packages of the organization. docker run -v $(pwd):/resources ghcr.io/rodnansol/jbang-catalog-document-generator: generate /resources/jbang-catalog.json -o /resources/jbang-catalog.adoc Custom header and custom footer can be attached to make sure introductions and other important stuff can be put into the final document. The alias entries can be extended with a help/usage section where the usage of the script can have a detailed description, for example if it is a CLI application the usage of the app or the flags can be put here. Example jbang-catalog.json { \"aliases\": { \"hello\": { \"script-ref\": \"hello.java\", \"description\": \"Script that says hello back for each argument\" } } } hello.txt This is a usage file, that will be rendered below the `hello` alias entry. !%$&@ So you want to use this script? !%$&@ jbang hello Script that says hello back for each argument This is a usage file, that will be rendered below the `hello` alias entry. !%$&@ So you want to use this script? !%$&@ It can put behind a collapsible section with the -cus (--collapsible-usage-section) flag. Since the 0.2.0 version the current working directory can be overwritten which can help you to read the usages from a different path if you wish. It can be overwritten with the -Dapp.document.current-working-directory= flag when using the java command. Example java -Dapp.document.current-working-directory=new-working/directory -jar jbang-catalog-document-generator-cli.jar generate jbang-catalog.json In this case the alias usages will be read from the new-working/directory folder. Please fork the project if you would like to contribute. The project requires at least GraalVM 22.3 / Java 17, if SDKMan is installed on your machine sdk e command could be used in the terminal to set up the required Java version. To build the project just run: mvn package The project contains a .editorconfig file, and it should be utilized as well. During build time Checkstyle checks the conventions.

The hackathon is based around GitHub Actions, GitHub’s CI/CD component and the Codespaces. In the announcement organizers listed multiple categories, and this one fits in the Wacky Wildcards (Build a random app that doesn’t fit into one of the categories above.). The announcement can be found here. What is the purpose of this project? What can we do with it? With the dawn of the AI techs, this little tool will help you make your pull requests have some sort of backstory, based on the commits they are containing. Most pieces of software are not really having documentations, and this tool is not a replacement of documentations, but a fun way to tell the story of the project/software/application via the pull request history and its commits. With the attached GitHub action you are able to hook it into your pull request lifecycles and at merge time, the action will kick in and will tell you the story of the pull request. You name the mood of the story, it can be funny, kind, strict, documentation like, anything you choose. name: Create story about Pull Request on: pull_request: types: - closed (1) jobs: create-story-for-pull-request: runs-on: ubuntu-latest name: Create story for pull request at merge if: github.event.pull_request.merged == true (2) steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v3 - uses: rodnansol/commit-teller-action@v0.1.0 (3) name: Create story with: version: early-access (4) arguments: create-story -pr ${ISSUE_NUMBER} --owner ${GITHUB_REPOSITORY%/*} --repository ${GITHUB_REPOSITORY#*/} --file-extension ADOC -saf=true (5) env: (6) ISSUE_NUMBER: ${{ github.event.number }} (7) COMMIT_TELLER_GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} (8) COMMIT_TELLER_OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_KEY }} (9) - name: Commit story changes (10) shell: bash env: ISSUE_NUMBER: ${{ github.event.number }} run: | git add *.adoc git config --global user.email \"${{ secrets.COMMITTER_EMAIL }}\" git config --global user.name \"${{ secrets.COMMITTER_NAME }}\" git commit -m \"Creating story about pull request ${ISSUE_NUMBER}\" git push origin main 1 Specify the event when the action must be executed, for example when the pull request gets closed (The close event can mean closed manually on the website, or by merging the pull request) 2 Specify if the action steps must be executed if the code changes are getting merged and not just the pull request is being closed by hand. 3 Add the rodnansol/commit-teller-action@v0.1.0 to your action. Check the latest version before doing so here. 4 Optional - Specify the version of the CLI tool you want to use. 5 Specify the command with the flags. Check the available flags here. 6 Check the customization options here. 7 GitHub action is providing the contextual data which contains the number of the issue/pull request. In the pull request context the issue word is interchangeable. 8 Specify the GitHub token. GitHub Action will always provide one when running the action, but it must be injected into the action. 9 Specify the OpenAI’s API key. Get one after registration here: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys 10 Optional - If you want to collect the stories inside your repository do not forget to commit them.
